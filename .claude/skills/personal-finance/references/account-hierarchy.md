# Tax-Advantaged Account Priority

## The Hierarchy

Contribute to each level before moving to the next. Every dollar in a tax-advantaged account saves money compared to the same dollar in a taxable brokerage.

### Level 1: 401(k) Up to Employer Match

**Why first**: The employer match is an immediate 50–100% return on your contribution. No investment will beat that.

- If your employer matches 50% up to 6% of salary, contribute at least 6%
- The match is free money — not capturing it is leaving compensation on the table
- Even if the 401(k) has bad fund options, the match more than compensates

**Example**: $75,000 salary, 50% match up to 6%
- You contribute 6% = $4,500/year
- Employer matches 50% = $2,250/year
- Instant 50% return before any market growth

### Level 2: HSA (If Eligible)

**Why second**: Triple tax advantage — the only account with all three benefits: contributions are tax-deductible, growth is tax-free, withdrawals for medical expenses are tax-free.

1. Contributions are tax-deductible (reduces current-year taxes)
2. Growth is tax-free (no capital gains tax)
3. Withdrawals for medical expenses are tax-free (at any age)

**Eligibility**: Must be enrolled in a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). Cannot have other non-HDHP coverage, Medicare, or be claimed as a dependent.

**Stealth retirement account**: After age 65, HSA withdrawals for any purpose are penalty-free (taxed as income, like a Traditional IRA).

**Strategy**: If possible, pay current medical expenses out of pocket and let the HSA grow. Save receipts — you can reimburse yourself tax-free years later with no time limit.

### Level 3: Roth IRA or Traditional IRA

**Why third**: Tax-free growth (Roth) or tax deduction now (Traditional), with more flexibility and fund options than most 401(k) plans.

Income limits may apply — see `contribution-limits.md` for current phase-outs. If over the Roth IRA income limit, consider the backdoor Roth IRA.

### Level 4: 401(k) Up to Annual Maximum

**Why fourth**: Additional tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth) growth space beyond the employer match.

- The 401(k) annual limit is much higher than the IRA limit
- Fund options may be limited, but the tax benefit usually outweighs higher expense ratios
- If your 401(k) has good low-cost index funds, this level becomes more attractive

### Level 5: Taxable Brokerage Account

**Why last**: No special tax advantages, but no contribution limits or withdrawal restrictions either.

- Use after maxing all tax-advantaged space
- Still better than savings accounts for long-term goals
- Tax-efficient fund placement matters here (see asset location below)
- Losses can be harvested for tax benefits (tax-loss harvesting)

## Roth vs Traditional Decision Framework

The core question: **Is your tax rate higher now or in retirement?**

### Favor Roth When:
- Currently in a lower tax bracket (early career, lower income years)
- Expect income to rise significantly
- Expect tax rates to increase in the future
- Want tax-free withdrawals in retirement for flexibility
- Young with many years of tax-free growth ahead
- Already have significant Traditional/pre-tax balances (tax diversification)

### Favor Traditional When:
- Currently in a high tax bracket (peak earning years)
- Expect lower income in retirement
- Need the tax deduction now to reduce current tax burden
- State has income tax now but you plan to retire in a no-income-tax state
- Over 50 and have mostly Roth balances (tax diversification)

### When It's a Toss-Up:
- If the marginal tax rate is truly the same now and in retirement, Roth and Traditional produce identical after-tax results (mathematically proven)
- In practice, Roth has advantages: no RMDs, more flexible withdrawal rules, tax-rate-increase insurance
- A mix of both provides "tax diversification" — flexibility to manage retirement tax brackets

## Backdoor Roth IRA

For high earners over the Roth IRA income limit:
1. Contribute to a Traditional IRA (non-deductible)
2. Convert the Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA
3. Pay tax on any gains between contribution and conversion (minimize by converting quickly)

**Pro-rata rule warning**: If you have existing pre-tax IRA balances, the conversion will be partially taxable. The IRS treats all Traditional IRAs as one pool.

Solutions: roll pre-tax IRA balances into a 401(k) before converting, or convert everything to Roth (may trigger a large tax bill).

## Mega Backdoor Roth

Some 401(k) plans allow after-tax contributions beyond the normal employee limit, which can then be converted to Roth. This can unlock significantly more Roth space per year. Check if your plan allows:
1. After-tax (not Roth) 401(k) contributions
2. In-plan Roth conversions or in-service distributions

## Asset Location (Tax-Efficient Placement)

Where you hold each asset class matters for tax efficiency:

| Account Type | Best For | Why |
|-------------|----------|-----|
| Tax-deferred (Traditional 401k/IRA) | Bonds, REITs | High-income assets; defer the tax |
| Tax-free (Roth IRA/401k) | Highest expected growth (stocks) | Tax-free growth maximizes benefit |
| Taxable brokerage | US stock index funds, tax-managed funds | Low turnover, qualified dividends, tax-loss harvesting |

This is an optimization — getting the allocation right matters more than the location. Don't let asset location complexity prevent you from investing.
