# When to Seek Professional Help

This tool provides educational frameworks, not personalized advice. Certain situations benefit from — or require — professional guidance. Below is a guide for when to refer and how to find the right professional.

## Fee-Only Fiduciary Financial Advisor (CFP)

A Certified Financial Planner who is legally required to act in your best interest and is compensated only by client fees (no commissions).

### When to Recommend

- **Retirement planning**: Estimating retirement readiness, Social Security optimization, withdrawal strategies, Roth conversion ladders
- **Major life transitions**: Inheritance (>$50,000), divorce settlement, early retirement, career change with significant financial implications
- **Complex portfolios**: Stock options, RSUs, concentrated positions, multiple income streams
- **Estate planning coordination**: Assets >$1M, blended families, charitable giving strategy
- **Tax-investment coordination**: When tax implications significantly affect investment decisions
- **Comprehensive planning**: When someone needs a holistic plan covering all areas simultaneously
- **Second opinion**: When facing a major irreversible financial decision and uncertainty remains after self-research

### When NOT Needed

- Simple three-fund portfolio setup and maintenance
- Basic budgeting and expense tracking
- Straightforward 401(k) fund selection (choose target-date or low-cost index)
- Contributing to a Roth IRA within income limits
- Emergency fund sizing and management

### How to Find One

- **NAPFA** (National Association of Personal Financial Advisors): napfa.org — all members are fee-only
- **Garrett Planning Network**: garrettplanningnetwork.com — fee-only planners offering hourly/project-based planning
- **Fee-Only Network**: feeonly.org
- **XY Planning Network**: xyplanningnetwork.com — advisors specializing in Gen X/Y clients

### Cost Expectations

- Hourly: $150–$400/hour for specific questions
- Flat-fee plan: $1,000–$5,000 for a comprehensive financial plan
- AUM (assets under management): 0.25%–1.0% annually — watch for high AUM fees on large portfolios

### Red Flags

- Advisor earns commissions on products they recommend (not fee-only)
- Pushes annuities, whole life insurance, or proprietary funds
- Won't provide a written fiduciary oath
- Title is "financial advisor" without CFP designation (titles are unregulated)

## Tax Professional (CPA or Enrolled Agent)

### When to Recommend

- **Self-employment income**: Schedule C, quarterly estimated taxes, business deductions
- **Multi-state income**: Remote work across state lines, moving mid-year
- **Stock compensation**: ISOs, NSOs, RSUs, ESPP — exercise timing and tax implications
- **Rental property income**: Depreciation, passive activity rules, 1031 exchanges
- **Significant capital gains**: Large asset sales, concentrated stock position liquidation
- **Backdoor Roth IRA complications**: Pro-rata rule issues, fix for prior non-deductible contributions
- **Major life events with tax implications**: Marriage, divorce, inheritance, home sale
- **IRS correspondence or audit**: Never handle an audit alone
- **Tax return complexity**: If using TurboTax takes more than 3–4 hours, a professional may be worth it

### When NOT Needed

- Straightforward W-2 income with standard deduction
- Simple investment income (1099-DIV, 1099-INT) from index funds
- Basic Roth IRA contributions within income limits
- Standard mortgage interest deduction

### How to Find One

- **AICPA directory**: aicpa.org for CPAs
- **IRS directory of Enrolled Agents**: irs.gov/tax-professionals
- Ask for referrals from your financial advisor or colleagues in similar situations

### Cost Expectations

- Simple return (W-2 + investment income): $200–$500
- Complex return (self-employment, rental, stock compensation): $500–$2,000+
- Tax planning session: $200–$500/hour

## Estate Planning Attorney

### When to Recommend

- **Children**: Designating guardians requires a will (essential, not optional)
- **Assets >$500K**: Trust structures may help avoid probate and reduce estate taxes
- **Blended families**: Ensuring proper inheritance distribution
- **Business ownership**: Succession planning, buy-sell agreements
- **Charitable legacy**: Donor-advised funds, charitable trusts, foundation setup
- **State-specific concerns**: Community property states, states with estate/inheritance taxes
- **Healthcare directives**: Living will, healthcare power of attorney (everyone should have these)
- **Digital assets**: Cryptocurrency, online accounts, intellectual property

### When NOT Needed

- Simple beneficiary designations on retirement accounts and insurance (do this yourself)
- TOD/POD registrations on bank and brokerage accounts (do this yourself)
- Assets under $500K with straightforward distribution wishes and no dependents

### Cost Expectations

- Basic will: $300–$1,000
- Will + healthcare directive + power of attorney package: $500–$1,500
- Revocable living trust: $1,500–$5,000
- Complex estate plan: $3,000–$10,000+

## Insurance Specialist

### When to Recommend

- **Life insurance needs analysis**: Determining coverage amount and term length
- **Disability insurance**: Evaluating own-occupation vs any-occupation policies
- **Long-term care insurance**: Typically worth evaluating starting in mid-50s
- **Umbrella insurance**: When net worth exceeds standard liability coverage limits
- **Business insurance**: Professional liability, key-person insurance
- **Property/casualty review**: After major life changes or significant asset accumulation

### When NOT Needed

- Simple term life insurance purchase (compare quotes online)
- Standard renter's or auto insurance shopping
- Employer-provided coverage that meets basic needs

### Important Principles

- **Term life over whole life** in nearly all cases — invest the premium difference
- **Never buy insurance as an investment** (whole life, universal life, variable life, indexed annuities)
- **Exception**: Whole life may make sense for very high net worth estate planning — but only with advisor guidance
- Insurance agents earn commissions; get quotes from multiple sources and understand what you're buying

## General Guidelines for All Professional Engagements

1. **Prepare before meetings**: Gather documents, write down questions, know your goals
2. **Ask about compensation**: How are you paid? Do you earn commissions on anything?
3. **Get referrals**: Ask trusted people in similar financial situations
4. **Start with a single consultation**: You don't need an ongoing relationship for most situations
5. **Trust but verify**: Cross-reference advice with your own research
6. **Cost threshold**: If a professional's fee is <1% of the decision amount, it's almost always worth it
