|--------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Married Filing Jointly | < $242,000 | $242,000–$252,000 | > $252,000 |

If neither spouse is covered by an employer plan, the full deduction is available at any income.

## MAGI Calculation Basics

Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) is used for IRA eligibility. For most people:

**MAGI = AGI + certain deductions added back**

Key add-backs:
- Student loan interest deduction
- Foreign earned income exclusion
- Excluded savings bond interest
- Excluded employer adoption benefits

For most W-2 employees without these items, MAGI ≈ AGI (line 11 on Form 1040).

## Important Notes

- All limits are per person. Married couples can each contribute their own limits.
- 401(k) employee limits are per person across all employers. If you have two jobs, the combined 401(k) contributions cannot exceed the annual limit.
- IRA limits are combined across all Traditional and Roth accounts per person.
- HSA limits are per coverage type (self-only vs family), not per person. One family HSA limit per HDHP family plan.
- These limits apply to the tax year, not the calendar year for IRAs (IRA contributions can be made up to the tax filing deadline, typically April 15 of the following year).
