# Three-Fund Portfolio

## The Concept

Three broad index funds together capture the entire investable market — every publicly traded stock and investment-grade bond worldwide. No overlap, no gaps, no need for anything else.

This approach is the cornerstone of the Bogleheads investment philosophy: maximum diversification with minimum complexity and cost.

## The Three Funds

| Asset Class | Purpose | What It Holds |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| US Total Stock Market | Domestic equity | ~4,000 US stocks across all sizes (large, mid, small cap) |
| International Total Stock Market | Non-US equity | ~8,000 stocks across developed and emerging markets |
| US Total Bond Market | Fixed income / stability | ~10,000 investment-grade US bonds (government, corporate, mortgage-backed) |

## Fund Picks by Brokerage

### Vanguard

| Asset Class | Mutual Fund | ETF | Expense Ratio |
|-------------|-------------|-----|---------------|
| US Total Stock Market | VTSAX ($3k min) | VTI | 0.03% |
| International Total Stock Market | VTIAX ($3k min) | VXUS | 0.07% |
| US Total Bond Market | VBTLX ($3k min) | BND | 0.03% |

### Fidelity

| Asset Class | Mutual Fund (Zero) | Mutual Fund (Index) | ETF | Expense Ratio |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----|---------------|
| US Total Stock Market | FZROX (0.00%) | FSKAX (0.015%) | FSKAX | 0.00–0.015% |
| International Total Stock Market | FZILX (0.00%) | FTIHX (0.06%) | — | 0.00–0.06% |
| US Total Bond Market | — | FXNAX (0.025%) | FXNAX | 0.025% |

Notes on Fidelity Zero funds: FZROX and FZILX have 0.00% expense ratios but are proprietary — they can only be held at Fidelity. If you might transfer brokerages later, the standard index funds or ETFs are more portable.

### Schwab

| Asset Class | Mutual Fund | ETF | Expense Ratio |
|-------------|-------------|-----|---------------|
| US Total Stock Market | SWTSX | SCHB | 0.03% |
| International Total Stock Market | SWISX (developed only) | SCHF + SCHE | 0.06% |
| US Total Bond Market | SWAGX | SCHZ | 0.03–0.04% |

Note: Schwab's international fund (SWISX) covers developed markets only. Add SCHE (emerging markets ETF) for full international coverage, or use SCHF + SCHE as an ETF pair.

## Why Three Funds Is Enough

**No overlap**: Each fund covers a distinct asset class. There's no redundancy — US total market doesn't hold international stocks, bonds don't hold stocks.

**No gaps**: Together they cover every publicly traded stock and investment-grade bond in the world. Adding sector funds, dividend funds, or REIT funds would create overlap with what's already in the total market fund.

**Market-cap weighted**: Total market index funds weight holdings by market capitalization. This means the portfolio self-adjusts as companies grow or shrink — no rebalancing within equity classes needed.

## Common Allocation Splits

### Stocks vs Bonds

The stock/bond split is the single most important investment decision. It determines ~90% of portfolio volatility and long-term returns.

| Age Range | Conservative | Moderate | Aggressive |
|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| 20s | 80/20 | 90/10 | 100/0 |
| 30s | 70/30 | 80/20 | 90/10 |
| 40s | 60/40 | 70/30 | 80/20 |
| 50s | 50/50 | 60/40 | 70/30 |
| 60s+ | 40/60 | 50/50 | 60/40 |

These are starting points. Adjust based on risk tolerance, other income sources, and financial situation.

### US vs International (Within Stocks)

| Approach | US | International | Rationale |
|----------|----|----|-----------|
| Global market cap | ~60% | ~40% | Matches the world economy |
| Slight home bias | 70% | 30% | Reduces currency risk, common simplification |
| Strong home bias | 80% | 20% | Minimum recommended international exposure |

The Bogleheads community doesn't have consensus on exact international allocation — anywhere from 20–40% is reasonable. The key is to have intentional international exposure rather than accidentally being 100% US.

## Target Date Funds as an Alternative

If even three funds feels like too much, a single target-date index fund (e.g., Vanguard Target Retirement 2055) holds all three asset classes and automatically adjusts the stock/bond ratio as the target date approaches.

Target-date funds are slightly higher cost (~0.12–0.15% vs ~0.03–0.05% for DIY three-fund) but are fully hands-off. This is a perfectly valid choice — the best portfolio is the one you'll stick with.
