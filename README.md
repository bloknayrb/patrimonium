# Money Money

[![AI Slop Inside](https://sladge.net/badge.svg)](https://sladge.net)

A personal finance management app built with Flutter, featuring local-first data storage, AI-powered insights, and forward-looking financial guidance.

## Features

### Customizable Dashboard (v0.4.7)
- **13 dashboard cards** — health score, forecast, net worth, spending analytics (tabbed: savings rate, cash flow, spending over time, by category, income vs expense), budgets, investments, mortgage, retirement, recent transactions, upcoming bills, goal progress, uncategorized nudge, subscription tracker
- **Edit mode** — drag to reorder, show/hide cards, toggle card size (full/half width on desktop)
- **Auto-hiding cards** — cards with no relevant data hide automatically (e.g., subscriptions card when no subscriptions detected)
- **Responsive layout** — single column on phone, multi-column on desktop with half-width card support
- **Persistent layout** — card order and visibility saved across app restarts, with automatic migration from legacy layouts

### Financial Guidance (v0.4.0)
- **Financial Health Score** — 0-100 composite score from 6 weighted pillars (emergency fund, debt-to-income, savings rate, budget adherence, net worth trend, retirement readiness) with a priority ladder telling you what to focus on next
- **Cash Flow Forecasting** — Projects account balances 30/60/90 days forward using recurring transactions, flags upcoming low-balance dates
- **Savings Rate + Analytics** — Multi-month income vs expense charts, savings rate trend with 20% goal line, category spending heatmap over time
- **Smart Alerts** — Budget threshold alerts, upcoming bill reminders, spending anomaly detection (flags categories >1.5x weekly average)
- **Debt Payoff Planner** — Snowball vs avalanche strategy comparison with interest savings calculation and per-debt payoff timelines

### Core Features
- **PIN Security** — PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 hashed PIN with optional auto-lock on backgrounding
- **Accounts** — Track 18 account types (checking, savings, credit card, investment, etc.) with full CRUD
- **Transactions** — Record income and expenses with category tagging, filtering, and search
- **Dashboard** — Customizable card-based overview with 13 financial widgets
- **Categories** — 16 expense and 7 income parent categories with subcategories, seeded on first launch
- **Bank Connectivity** — SimpleFIN integration with multi-login support, automatic account sync
- **CSV Import** — Column mapping, preview, and import history
- **Budgets** — Budget tracking with category-based spending limits and AI-powered suggestions
- **Goals** — Financial goal tracking with progress monitoring
- **Retirement Projections** — Monte Carlo simulation with percentile bands, configured via AI-powered conversational interview
- **Recurring Transactions** — Automatic detection of recurring income and expenses
- **Auto-Categorization** — Two-tier system with 300 default merchant rules and learned mappings from manual assignments
- **AI Assistant** — Natural language interaction for insights and automated parameter extraction (Retirement, Budgeting)
- **Data Export** — CSV export for accounts and transactions
- **Material 3 Theming** — Dynamic color support with semantic finance colors (income=green, expense=red)
- **Offline-First** — All data stored locally in SQLite via Drift ORM

## AI Assistant & Data Privacy

The AI assistant provides natural language chat and dashboard insights by sending a snapshot of your financial data to your configured LLM provider. Here's exactly what it sees.

### Data sent to the LLM (each message or insight request)

- **Account names, types, and balances** (top 10 by balance) — e.g., "Primary Checking (checking): $5,234.00"
- **Net worth total**
- **Recent 20 transactions** with date, payee name, and amount — e.g., "3/15 AMAZON: -$45.99"
- **Top 10 spending categories** with 30-day totals — e.g., "Groceries: $456.00"
- **Active budgets** with category name and per-period limit
- **Active goals** with name, current/target amounts, and retirement details (year, monthly contribution) if applicable
- **Monthly savings rate** percentage

### Data never sent

- Account numbers or routing numbers
- Bank login credentials or SimpleFIN tokens
- Your PIN or biometric data
- API keys for other services
- Transaction IDs or internal database identifiers
- Raw CSV files or full transaction history

### How it works

- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** — the app ships with no bundled API key. You configure your own provider and key in Settings.
- **4 supported providers**: Gemini (Google), Claude (Anthropic), OpenAI, Ollama (local/self-hosted)
- **Context is rebuilt fresh** each conversation turn from your local database — the app does not maintain server-side state.
- **All chat history stays local** in the on-device SQLite database. The app does not store conversations on any server.
- **Fully local option**: Ollama enables inference with no data leaving your device (requires a separate Ollama server).

## Platforms

- Android
- Linux desktop

> Web builds are not supported due to a `dart:ffi` dependency (sqlite3).

## Architecture

Clean Architecture with three layers:

```
lib/
├── core/          # Constants, DI (Riverpod), extensions, routing (GoRouter), theme
├── data/          # Drift database, repositories, secure storage
├── domain/        # Use cases, business logic, auth
└── presentation/  # Screens, providers, shared widgets
```

**State Management**: Manual Riverpod providers (not riverpod_generator).
**Database**: Drift with 21 tables — money as integer cents, UUIDs for PKs, Unix ms for timestamps.
**Routing**: GoRouter with `StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack` for 5-tab bottom navigation.

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed architecture documentation, build commands, and development conventions.

| Phase 2 — Accounts & Transactions | Complete | Accounts CRUD, transactions CRUD, dashboard, category picker |
| Phase 3 — Bank Connectivity | Complete | SimpleFIN sync, CSV import, budgets, goals, recurring detection, auto-categorization, AI assistant, retirement projections (Monte Carlo), architecture hardening |
| Phase 4 — Forward-Looking Finance | Complete | Financial health score, cash flow forecasting, savings rate analytics, smart alerts, debt payoff planner (v0.4.0) |
| Phase 5 — Dashboard Customization | Complete | Customizable dashboard with 13 cards (5 spending cards consolidated into 1 tabbed card), edit mode, responsive layout (v0.4.7) |

## Dev Data Seeder

In debug builds, the app automatically seeds 7 accounts and ~150 transactions on first launch, giving the dashboard, accounts, and transactions screens realistic data to work with. The seeder is idempotent — it only runs when no accounts exist.

**Seeded accounts:** Primary Checking (Chase), Emergency Savings (Ally), Rewards Credit Card (Chase), Roth IRA (Fidelity), 401k (Fidelity), Auto Loan (Capital One), Brokerage (Robinhood).

**Transactions** span 4 months of checking, credit card, and savings activity (groceries, gas, dining, subscriptions, transfers, etc.). Categories are assigned automatically by the auto-categorization rules that run immediately after seeding.

To verify:
1. Uninstall the app (or clear app data) to start fresh
2. Run `flutter run` (debug mode)
3. Dashboard should show ~$137k net worth, cash flow chart, and recent transactions
4. Accounts screen shows 7 accounts with balances
5. Transactions screen shows ~150 categorized transactions
6. Second launch skips seeding (accounts already exist)

The seeder is gated behind `kDebugMode` and does not run in release builds.

## Development Guidelines

Development conventions, testing patterns, performance guidelines, and deployment checklists are documented in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md). Key points:

- All money values are **integer cents** (never floating point)
- Expenses are stored as **negative** `amountCents`
- Use `flutter analyze` to check for lint issues before committing
- Run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` after changing Drift table schemas
